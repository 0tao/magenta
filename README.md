Magenta is a project from the [Google Brain
team](https://research.google.com/teams/brain/) that asks: Can we use
machine learning to create compelling art and music? If so, how? If
not, why not?  We’ll use [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org), and
we’ll release our models and tools in open source on this GitHub. We’ll
also post demos, tutorial blog postings and technical papers. Soon
we’ll begin accepting code contributions from the community at
large. If you’d like to keep up on Magenta as it grows, you can 
read our [blog](https://magenta.tensorflow.org) and or join our
[discussion group](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!forum/magenta-discuss).
